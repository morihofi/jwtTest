# ✍️☕ JWT Test in Java
This Java JWT project generates and verifies JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) using the Auth0 JWT library. 
The project creates a symmetric key using the HmacSHA256 algorithm, and generates a JWT with an 
issuer, an expiration time, a not-before time, and a custom payload. 

The generated token is then verified using the same symmetric key. The project demonstrates
how to generate and verify JWTs using the Auth0 library in a simple and straightforward way.

## Verify it online
You can verify the generated Token at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).
Make sure you check "secret base64 encoded".
